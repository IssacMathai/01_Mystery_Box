MysteryBoxGame was created for my Digital Technologies class while in Year 13 of high school. We had 3 weeks worth of classes to create this game with the purpose of learning more advanced python as well as how to use tkinter. After creating this, I moved on to creating MeasurementConverter, which was my assessed python tkinter application. I received an Excellence grade for my 'iterative improvement' (planning, documenting changes) and a Merit grade for the program overall.

To play the game, run game.exe which is located in the src folder.
