MysteryBoxGame was created for my Digital Technologies class while in Year 13 of high school. We had 3 weeks worth of classes to create this game with the purpose of learning more advanced python as well as how to use tkinter.

The plan for writing the code was to let each GUI window has its own class. This simple structure helped with readability and bug fixing as I immediately knew which section of the code to look at.

**Dependencies:**
* tkinter
* functools
* random
* re

After creating this, I moved on to creating MeasurementConverter, which was my assessed python tkinter application. I received an Excellence grade for my 'iterative improvement' (planning, documenting changes) and a Merit grade for the program overall.

To play the game, run game.exe which is located in the src folder.
